# Todoist Clone

This is part of a self-ed project that clones the UI and functionality of [Todoist](https://todoist.com). This specific repository holds the front end web app for the project.

## Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run locally, start by cloning this repo and installing dependencies

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/poutler/todoist-clone-web
   cd ./todoist-clone-web
   yarn
```

From there, you can use the scripts provided by Create React App to run, test, build, and deploy.
